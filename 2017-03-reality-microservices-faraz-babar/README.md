We had great meet-up tonight, presented by *Faraz Babar*. He discussed an approach to micro-services particularly useful for `Finite Inventory, Rapid Exhaustion (FIRE)` domains (e.g. ticket sales). These domains are ideal for CQRS/ES modeling, such that, write-side actions are decoupled from read-side interpretations which enables extremely high transactional throughput. By utilizing reactive messaging patterns, Faraz demonstrated the ability to create memory-resident distributed services which further enabled low-latency and lock-free transactions.
